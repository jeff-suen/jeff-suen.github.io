# 🗨 About Me
My name is Shuju Sun and you can call me Jeffery. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in spatial data science at the University of Southern California (https://www.usc.edu/). 

Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Commerce with an specialization in Accounting from University of British Columbia in Canada (https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/). Currently, I am seeking an internship opportunity to apply my data science techniques such as data engineering, machine learning, deep learning and some other skills. I am an enthusiast in metaverse, smart city development and AI4Finance.
